description: Source code syntax highlighting in the chat window.

    Markdown-style syntax is supported, i.e. text inbetween `single backticks` is rendered as inline code.
    ```language
    selection is possible in multi-line code snippets inbetween triple-backticks
    Note the newlines in this caseâ€¦
    ```

    Changed settings will take effect after re-opening the message tab/window.
