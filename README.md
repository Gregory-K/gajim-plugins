## Welcome to the Gajim Plugins Wiki
                
In this place you find all plugins that are written for <a href="https://gajim.org">Gajim</a> by the community. If you experience any problems with those plugins, please report them here.

## How to install plugins

There are several ways to install a plugin:

 - You can browse / download / enable / configure plugins from within Gajim via 'Gajim' > 'Plugins' menu.
 - You can also clone the repository directly from our Git and copy it to:

    **Linux:** `~/.local/share/gajim/plugins/`

    **Windows:** `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Gajim\Plugins`

 - Alternatively (for developing), you can also symlink the gajim-plugins repository to Gajim's plugin path
 
    **Symlink:** `ln -s /path/to/gajim-plugins-repository/* ~/.local/share/gajim/plugins/`

**For each major Gajim version there is a different plugins branch:**

| Version | Plugins branch |
| ------- | -------------- |
|Gajim 1.0|[1.0 branch](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins/tree/gajim_1.0)|
|Gajim 1.1|[1.1 branch](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins/tree/gajim_1.1)|
|Gajim master|[master branch](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins/tree/master)|

*Note: Using master branch for plugins requires frequent updates of both Gajim and plugins!*
